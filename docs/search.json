    "text": "As Duke University students, we are very interested and invested in basketball. Each year, Duke sends basketball players to the NBA and many perform very well throughout their professional careers. Our group is interested in what distinguishes good players in the NBA from great, exceptional players. Particularly, how is a single MVP chosen from hundreds of professional basketball players each season?\nWe considered Vivek Datta’s findings during our research on this topic, which he details in “Evolution of the NBA” (Datta 2018) Written in 2018, this article articulates the progression of NBA individual players, teams, and rules from 1976 to 2018. Datta explains that offense has become less structured and more fast-paced over the aforementioned time period; offenses previously depended on larger men to score, but now primarily rely on three-pointers. This forces the defense to spread out, and larger men must therefore have greater agility to guard smaller guards. Further, the NBA shifted to a prohibition of hand-checking, which is the defender’s use of hands and arms to prevent an offensive player from moving forward. This change has enabled smaller players to be more competitive by reducing contact and increasing perimeter (mid-range) shots. These factors, coupled with many others Datta discusses, have a large impact on player performance and subsequent effect on MVP selection criteria.\nWhile Datta’s study investigates the 1976-2018 seasons, his research is broader than our interests. He focuses on large-scale trends between offense and defense in his analysis. We want to focus more on the qualities that best predict MVPs rather than changes to the overall game and will thus investigate the 1997-2022 seasons to identify emerging trends in MVP selection criteria."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nWhen the data was first read into RStudio, some changes were made to make the data set more workable.\n\nVariables that began with numbers (ex. 3P, which represents average three-pointers per game) were renamed to begin with letters (ex. threeP). This allowed for the variables to be read into data visualizations.\n\n\nThe MVP variable was converted from a boolean to a factor and leveled such that the ordering was False then True. This ordering was chosen so that the logistic model (explained in future sections) would output probabilities of MVP status being True.\n\n\nA separate data set was also created that contained only the MVP winners (in the season they won the award). This allowed for data visualization and data re-balancing (explained in Methodology Part 2).\n\n\nPart 1: Exploring the Data Set\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP Status\nNumber of Observations\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n14548\n99.8284499\n\n\nTRUE\n25\n0.1715501\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows that the number of non-MVPs in the dataset vastly outnumbers the number of MVPs. Over 99.8% of the dataset is non-MVPs, while only .17% is MVPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP Status\nMedian Average Points Per Game\n\n\n\n\nMVP\n27.1\n\n\nNon-MVP\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot above compares the average points per game of MVPs and non-MVPs. There is a distinct difference in the average points scored per game across the two groups. The table confirmed this data: MVP winners (in the season they won the MVP) had a median score of 27.1 points per game on average, but non-MVP winners had a median score of 6.4 points per game on average. That is over a 4-fold difference in the median average points scored per game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP Status\nMedian Average Playing Time (Minutes)\n\n\n\n\nMVP\n37.4\n\n\nNon-MVP\n18.9\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot above compares the average minutes played per game of MVPs and non-MVPs. There is a distinct difference in the average minutes played per game across the two groups. However, in the non-MVP group, there is a much higher spread and much more variability in the data compared to the MVP group (likely due in part to a much higher number of observations). The table quantifies this data: MVP winners had a median average playing time of 37.4 minutes per game, and non-MVP winners had a median average playing time of 18.9 minutes per game. That is approximately a 2-fold difference in median average playing time per game!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot above depicts the distribution of positions of only MVP winners. As the data shows, shooting guards, small forwards, and centers had about 3-4 MVP winners each from the 1997-2022 NBA seasons, and point guards and power forwards had slightly more MVP winners (6 and 8 MVP winners each, respectively) during that same time period. Unfortunately, because the data set of MVP winners is so small, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this data about whether certain positions are more likely to win the MVP award compared to others.\nThe data explorations above support the following conclusions:\n\nThe data set is very unbalanced. There is a disproportionate amount of non-MVP winners in the data set compared to MVP winners\nHigh average points per game and high average playing time may be good indicators of MVP status.\nNo conclusions can be drawn about which positions are more or less likely to win MVP status.\n\nGiven these conclusions, we felt it was best to attempt to re-balance the data set before moving forward in our exploration. This is because our ultimate goal is to be able to predict MVP winners. When a data set is so unbalanced and the MVP winners are very diluted, it can be difficult to pick out trends within the data and build a model to predict whether a player is an MVP winner (as the model would default to non-MVP status due to the sheer quantity of those observations). Therefore, we re-balance the data set in the following section in an attempt to mitigate this issue.\n\n\nPart 2: Re-balancing the Data Set\nAs mentioned previously, we are interested in identifying what differentiates MVPs from all other NBA basketball players. Thus, it makes sense that in order to understand the difference between good and great players, we choose a subset of excellent players for our smaller data set. Thus, we chose to re-balance our data set based on average points per game and average minutes played per game because those variables were previously shown to be higher in MVPs than non-MVPs.\nFirst, we created a data set that contained the top 5 players with the highest average points per game for each season. Second, we created a data set that contained the top 5 players with the highest average playing time per game for each season. Then, we merged the data sets, keeping all observations from both data sets. If a given player-year observation was in both of the top 5 data sets, others were not added in. This decision was made to keep the size of the data set reasonably small. Finally, we merged the data set with the data set containing only the MVP winners.\nThe final data set contained 222 unique observations with the highest average scorers, the players with the most average playing time, and the MVPs from each season from the 1997-1998 season through the 2021-2022 season. This is much smaller than the original data set that contained 14,573 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP Status\nNumber of Observations\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n197\n88.73874\n\n\nTRUE\n25\n11.26126\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the table shows above, in the new data set, 11.3% of observations are MVP winners, and 88.7% are non-MVP winners. There is still an imbalance between MVP and non-MVP winners, but much less so compared to the original data set.\n\n\nPart 3: Main Methodology\nNow that we have re-balanced our data set, we plan to gain a more comprehensive understanding of which variables are best predictors of MVP status among these competitive players. As mentioned in our introduction, there are a variety of quantitative variables this data set provides, such as average steals per game, average defensive rebounds per game, average offensive rebounds per game…etc. There are 28 such columns that provide different statistics about a given player for a given season.\nTo answer our research question, we plan to build a logistic model that predicts the log odds of a given player-year observation being an MVP. The model with the lowest AIC is the combination of variables that best predicts the log odds of MVP status. The stepAIC is a method used for stepwise model selection. Given a data set and a set of variables, it can iterate through all combinations of such variables to identify which combination of variables provides the best logistic model to predict MVP status. We plan to use this stepAIC to determine which variables and what combination of them are best predictors of MVP status.\nWe then plan to assess the performance of this model. We will test the model on a portion of the data set it has not been trained on. A confusion matrix will be used to visualize the results. In particular, the matrix will display the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negative outcomes of the model."

    "text": "Results\nFirst, we split our data set into a training data set and testing data set. The training data set contains 80% of the observations and will be used to train the model. The testing data set contains 20% of the observations and will be used to test the model.\nThen, we performed a forward stepAIC using the 26 basketball statistic variables from the data set to pick the “best” overall model for predicting MVP Status. All variables were input into the model. The model output is written below. The model gives the log odds of a player-year observation being an MVP given their statistics for the variables in the equation. The AIC for this model is 81.16.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{1-\\hat{p}}\\Big) = -31.00 + 0.6400 \\times PTS + 103.1 \\times FGPerc +\n0.8510\\times AST \\\\- 62.26 \\times twoPPerc - 1.318 \\times FG + 18.05 \\times GS\n-18.03 \\times G + 0.8793 \\times BLK\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe following explanatory variables were included in the best-fit additive model: average points per game, field goal percentage, average steals per game, 2-pointer percentage, average field goals per game, number of games started, number of games played, and average blocks per game.\nHolding other variables constant, variables with positive coefficients (ex. average points per game and field goal percentage) indicate an increase in such statistics increase the log odds of being MVP. On the other hand, variables with negative coefficients (ex. 2-pointer percentage and average and number of games played) indicate an increase in such statistics decreases the log odds of being MVP.\nAdditionally, certain variables have higher coefficients than others. This means that for a 1 unit increase in a given variable, we estimate on average a higher increase in the log odds of MVP status than that of a variable with a lower coefficient (holding all other variables constant). For instance, a 1 unit increase in field goal percentage (coefficient of 103.1) increases the log odds of MVP status more than a 1 unit increase in average blocks per game (coefficient of 0.8793).\nOverall, this model identifies the 8 predictors that best predict MVP status from the input data set, which answers our central research question. It also tells us whether an increase in those predictors increases or decreases the log odds of MVP status and how much we estimate on average each variable changes the log odds of MVP status per a 1 unit change in that variable.\n\nAssessing the Predictive Strength of the Model\n\n\n\n\n\nThe confusion matrix above shows the model results on the testing data set. Given that a player-year observation is an MVP, the model correctly predicts this 16.67% of the time. This indicates the sensitivity of the model is low. Given a player-year observation is not an MVP, the model correctly predicts this 89.74% of the time. This indicates the specificity of the model is high.\nThe F-1 score of this model is .1818. F-1 score was chosen as a metric to evaluate the model because it is a good metric for imbalanced data. Ideally, F-1 scores should be high (close to 1). Our low F-1 score indicates this model has weak overall performance.\nThis serves to qualify the validity of the answer to our research question above (the 8 proposed best predictors from our model) as it suggests the model is not very reliable.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nSummary\nThe goal of our data analysis was to pinpoint the qualities that the NBA values the most when selecting an MVP. We hypothesized that the average number of three-pointers per game would be one of the best MVP predictors and that most of the best MVP predictors are related to offense. To find the best model for predicting MVPs, we used step-wise logistic regression, which outputted the model with the following explanatory variables: average points per game, field goal percentage, number of games started, 2-pointer percentage, average assists per game, average field goals per game, number of games played, and average blocks per game has the lowest AIC. Since the average number of three-pointers per game is not among these eight best predictors of MVP status, that part of our hypothesis was not supported. However, many of the variables the model outputted were related to offense (ex. average points per game, field goal percentage, average assists per game), which supports that component of our hypothesis.\nFurthermore, our confusion matrix assessed the predictive strength of the model generated from the stepAIC procedure. Our output indicated that our model was a relatively poor predictor of MVP status. This is likely in part because our data set was still largely unbalanced, despite efforts to re-balance it. The weakness of our model tells us we can not conclude the 8 variables outputted by the model are confidently the best predictors of MVP status. Rather, further statistical analysis is required to verify and refine these findings.\n\n\nReliability & Validity of Data\nIt is important to consider the reliability and validity of our data. Our data on offensive statistics being strong predictors of MVP status makes sense given what we know in the context of the NBA. The NBA has a strong emphasis on offensive performance. This helps to validate some of our findings. In terms of reliability of the data, the NBA has automated systems for collecting player statistics and cameras installed in the catwalks of every NBA arena. Furthermore, Second Spectrum software tracks the movements of every player on the court and the basketball 25 times per second. This strengthens the reliability of the data, given the rigor at which it is collected.\nTo expand on the reliability and validity of our data, we chose our re-balance our data set based on the average points per game and average minutes played per game. In retrospect, while average points per game was one of the 8 predictors of the model output, average minutes played per game was not. This indicates the data set input into the model could have made the model less reliable. In the future, the data set could be subset based on field goal percentage and number of games started, as those two variables had high positive coefficients, meaning per 1 unit increase in those variables, they most increased the log odds of MVP status compared to the other variables.\n\n\nScope of Inference\nThe scope of inference is relatively limited to the NBA at the current time range. The NBA differs from the WNBA and the EuroLeague in that the NBA is much more offensively focused, which means the skills valued in an MVP in one league may not transfer over to the other leagues. In these cases, other leagues may place more value on defensive qualities, such as average blocks or steals per game, which may be better predictors of MVP status. The scope of inference is also limited by time. Although not explored in this project, it is likely that the qualities that the NBA values change over time, meaning a model that successfully predicts MVPs from the 1997-2022 seasons may not be as relevant in future years.\n\n\nLimitations & Future Areas of Research\nA limitation touched upon in the previous subsection was how our findings may not translate through time given the changing nature of valued MVP qualities. To contemporize our findings, we can collect data from upcoming NBA seasons and add them to the data set to see how new players and seasons affect our findings.\nAnother central limitation of our project is the imbalance in our data set between MVPs and non-MVPs. While this will always be an issue due to the inherent selectivity of the award, this issue can be minimized by performing analyses on only MVP-nominated players across many seasons. This could help to better assess what makes MVP winners stand out amongst other MVP nominees while keeping the data set size relatively small.\nAn area for future research and exploration is using a different type of logistic model. In this project, we fit a step-wise additive model, but we also could have fit an interactive model. This interactive model would add a layer of complexity to the model by exploring how multiple variables interact with one another to influence MVP status. If the AIC of the interactive model is lower than that of the additive model, it may help to better predict the likelihood of MVP status."

Our group sought to investigate the basketball statistics that are the best predictors of NBA MVP status from the 1997 to the 2022 NBA seasons. We hypothesized that the number of three-pointers per game is one of the best MVP predictors and that most of the best MVP predictors are related to offense. To answer this question, we performed a stepwise logistic regression to identify a combination of factors that best predicts MVP status. Those factors were the following: average points per game, field goals percentage, number of games started, 2-pointer percentage, average assists per game, average field goals per game, number of games played, and average blocks per game. Our resulting model had low sensitivity and high specificity, but we believe it helps to better understand the qualities valued in the selection of MVPs."

Each NBA player represents an observation; for each player there is information on their position, age, their team, games played, games started, minutes played, field goals, field goals attempted, 2 point field goals, 3 point field goals, etc. (we have included just the first 10 variables here for now because there are so many).\nEthical Concerns.\nThough seemingly minor, when collecting/compiling/re-publishing data, it is essential that those collecting (in this case Eduardo Tocco) act ethically responsible by granting proper credit to the original source of the data (NBA). Moreover, although the original data was public, players and others relevant to the data should be kept informed when re-collecting and re-analyzing the statistics in different contexts; those compiling already public information should also still take into consideration the mental impact on players when stats from old games are being re-publicized and re-analyzed in new and different ways. In this case, it is especially true because the information relates to mistakes made in games and other emotion-provoking information that may impact player morality, well-being, and public relations."

The data is made available to the public through the Office of Post-secondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education. Since the data set contains information from the years 2015-2019, the data was collected in those 5 years.\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nEach observation is a university for a given year and sport. Each observation also has information about the location of the school, sports conference, number of male and female athletes, revenue for a given men’s and women’s team, and expenditures for those teams.\nEthical Concerns\nAt first consideration, there are not many ethical concerns regarding the collection and use of this data; there is no personally identifiable information (used information is about a university and sports team at the aggregate level), and the U.S. Department of Education has made this data publicly available for the public to use and access. However, a potential concern in the collection of this data is that universities self-report the data. This could be a potential source of bias and misinformation. Taking a glance at the dataset reveals there are a considerable number of NA values for the revenue of a male or female team while the data for the other gender is provided. It is unclear whether this lack of data is entirely because a university does not have a team for that gender or whether the data was simply not reported. If the latter is true, this could be potential source of non-response bias in the collection of this data."

NCAA External Gender Equity Review, Phase II. NCAA Gender Review. https://ncaagenderequityreview.com/\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\nThe “NCAA External Gender Equity Review Phase II” was published on October 25, 2021 as a further investigation (also implements addenda and new findings) after the August 2021 Review (Phase I). Kaplan Heckler & Fink LLP are a law firm that was hired by the NCAA to investigate gender equity in collegiate sports in early 2021, and completed their Phase II investigation over the course of three months. In this specific report, Heckler & Fink expose that the NCAA has invested more expenditure into championships they deem as more “revenue-producing,” all of which have been men’s sports; in turn, a cycle of inequity between men and women’s sports has been created and perpetuated within the NCAA. The report takes a broader view in the specifics of championships to decipher the effect of policy and practice in contribution to this inequity through investigating patterns. Findings have indicated a range of NCAA conflicts in regards to gender inequity; some include that the NCAA has a culture that promotes revenue-producing for gender inequity, media promotes unequal investment for both genders in sports, the NCAA lacks necessary compositions to implement and sustain gender equality, and independent staff operation for both sports furthers inequity. The report delves into these conflicts and provides recommendations for alleviation, and also presents some captivating information on spending. In specific relation to championships, the report reflects that spending has been influenced by revenue; in baseball/softball, ice hockey, lacrosse, gymnastics, soccer, and volleyball, the NCAA has made a significantly greater investment in sport championships for men than women (page 21).\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on the cited article by conducting a statistical analysis on data to investigate inequity between men and women’s collegiate sports; however, we are taking a more specific lens within the issue by specifically studying revenue and expenditure (the report took a broader lens in considering many contributing factors largely relating to culture). Interestingly, data from Kaplan & Heckler’s findings also support a particular sector of our hypothesis: that disparity is more prevalent in Division I than Division II and III Sports; we look forward to exploring how expenditure and revenue play into this."

Open data is information that is available to and can be freely used by all.\nState when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).\nThe data for Durham Neighborhood Permit Values (2012) was collected by the Durham City/County Inspections Department, who provides permit, plan review, and inspection services for the city and county of Durham. These services ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the public through administration and enforcement of North Carolina State Building Code and zoning ordinances for both the city and county. \nThe data for NC School Performance (2016-2017) was collected by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NC DPI), which oversees the public school system in North Carolina. All states has an overarching department/organization to monitor public schools within their state (DPI is North Carolina specific); therein, the NC DPI uses specialized data systems to manage and analyze student data for internal information gathering and subsequent external planning.\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nThis Durham Neighborhood Permit Values data set includes 155 rows and 24 columns. Each row represents a Durham neighborhood and each column represents a variable. For example, one variable is value per square mile.\nThe data for NC School Performance includes 85,767 rows and 32 columns. Each row represents a specific district, school, grade, and subject, and each column represents a variable. Some variables include district name, school code, school name, subject, standard (proficiency), race, EDS (economically disadvantaged), LEP (limited english proficient), SWD (students with disabilities), and AIG (academically and intellectually gifted).\nEthical Concerns\nResearching the relationship between wealth and academic performance may highlight disparities in education outcomes. It’s important to address any ethical concerns associated with these disparities and to consider the potential consequences of highlighting these inequalities. Stigmatizing students based on their socioeconomic status can be harmful; researchers and analyzers must be careful not to perpetuate stereotypes of economically disadvantaged students both in thought and research productions. Therein, it is important to be aware of biases and work to conduct research objectively. Lastly, ethical concerns regarding the data should be considered closely to avoid revealing the identities of individuals and communities, given that individual observations include information that could be potentially revealing (school name, race, specifics of economic standing/english proficiency/disability status and more)."

Titled “Providing an Equal Opportunity for a Sound Basic Education in North Carolina’s High‐Poverty Schools: Assessing Needs and Opportunities,” the report details six areas of findings in regards to High-Poverty North Carolina Schools, including large numbers of schools and students, less access to adequate education, less access to accountability (Leandro tenets), lack of outside risk-addressing, and systemic barriers. One specific section of the report specifically details that high-poverty schools are disproportionately schools of color (who are also mostly from poor economic circumstances); further Hispanic, Black, and American Indian children represent the majority of children in low income families in North Carolina (page 21). Presented statistics also corroborate that high-poverty schools are also often attended by students with other risk factors, namely ELL (english language learners) and SWD (page 24). Finally, in looking at high school outcomes by economic status, the report reflects that while high school graduation rates between economically disadvantaged students and their advantaged counterparts, test score performance is disparate. The report details the other aforementioned sections before concluding with recommendations for the NC DPI.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOut research question directly relates to the issues identified and discussed by the article.
